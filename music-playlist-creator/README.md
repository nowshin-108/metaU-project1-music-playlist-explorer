### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The labs were useful. But took a lot of time. It would have been great if I could get more time to finish the project.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
Yes, I would definitely add more features and make the UI more user-friendly. One of the features would be linking actual audio with the songs.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Although I haven'y done my demo yet, I really enjoyed my peer's demos. They were all fantastic and give me more clarify about the project. Specially I loved Zara's UI.
